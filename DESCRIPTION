I added a TNT Minecart (complete with rails) to Bloxd. 
Use it by pasting all the code in README.md in world code. 
Because it uses 11 Callbacks for fixng as most errors as possible, 
you should have an empty world code.

HOW TO USE:

Crafting Recipes:

    1 TNT Minecart 
    (Gray Quick Paintball Explosive Item)

      1 Moonstone Explosive
      5 Iron Bar

    16 Rails
    (Spawn Block (Gray))

      6 Iron Bar
      1 Stick

    16 Powered Rails
    (Spawn Block (Orange))

      6 Gold Bar
      1 Stick



TNT Minecart is only placeable on one of this rails. 
When standing on rails, the minecart won't move from it. 
A minecart is pushable by walking against it, and it speeds up in arrow direction on powered rails. 
IMPORTANT: Because tick callback is not called often enough to fix it, you have to put 2 blocks at 
corners, look in the images for more info.
